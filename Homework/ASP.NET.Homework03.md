#### ASP.NET Homework 3

1. **The book states, “Interactions with an MVC application follow a natural cycle of user actions and view
updates, where the view is assumed to be stateless.” What does it mean for the view to be stateless?**
  -
2. **The book identifies two kinds of models. Briefly desdribe each of them.**
  - View Model: data passed from controller to the views
  - Domain Model: contains the data in a business domain, along with the operations, transformations, and rules for creating, storing, and manipulating the data. collectively referred to as the Model Logic.
3. **Give an example of separation of concerns from your own life experience. This should be a simple,
everyday example.**
  - My dresser. Each drawer contains it's items.
4. **What is a view engine?**
  - Processes a view in order to generate a response for the browser
5. **The book notes that the three-tier structure, or n-tier model, is “the most widely used pattern for
business applications.” Why do you think that this is true? An answer like, “Because it works well,”
is not a sufficient answer to this question.**
  - It provides good separation of concerns without being too complicated
6. **This question requires some outside research. When we study UWP, you will see that the UWP design
pattern is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM). What is the difference between MVC and MVVM
that makes the first good for ASP.NET MVC and the second good for UWP?**
  -
7. **Describe the two parts of the dependency injection (DI) design pattern.**
  - allows you to decouple components to enforce a strict separation between the parts of an application.
8. **Give an example of loose coupling from your own life experience. This should be a simple, everyday
example.**
  -
9. **What are the two types of testing discussed in the book?**
  -
10. **What are the seven steps of the test driven development (TDD) workflow, as stated in the book?**
