What are Unit Tests?
- Unit Tests are used to validate the behavior of individual components and features in an application
 Conventionally, how are test methods named and why?
- The name typically describes what the test does. It makes it easier to structure the tests in a project and understand the results.
What is the pattern that a unit test follows, and briefly describe each part.
- AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert
 - Arrange - Sets up the conditions
 - Act - Refers to performing the test
 - Assert - Refers to verifying that the result was the one that was expected
What is the purpose of Test-Driven Development, and what does it lead to.
- You write tests for a feature before implementing the feature. It encourages the developer to think more about how the feature works rather than details
- It leads to more robust and reliable code
What is a Mock Framework and why is it useful?
- It's a package for creating fake implementations of compnents in an application.
- It makes it easier to create fake compnents to isolate parts of the application for unit testing
